Python code which I did as my exercise 2 which contain the following question
Exercise 
Solve the following exercises in Jupyter Notebook, run all cells and download as pdf
document. Return your pdf in Assignment 2 created under module Python Part I. 
1. Define two variables and assign them values of 100 and 29. After this, make the interpreter sum up the 
two numbers and multiply their result by 3. 
Calculate the 2nd exponent of the previous number and save it to a new variable.
Make the program print the result in the following way:
The result of the calculation was:
149769
Make sure you use valid variable names and name your variables meaningfully.
Make sure that output of your program has indentation as shown in the above example.
2. Write a program that creates a password by asking the user to input their name, age, year of birth. 
Save all in separate variables using the right type for each of them. Program should create the 
password in following way: takes last two digits of year of birth, first 3 letters from name, and the 2nd
power of the age according to the example below:
Name: John
Year of birt: 1995
Age: 26
Password: 95Joh676
Hint: to get the desired output in print() all variables has to be type str.
3. Write a program that asks for two numbers. If both numbers are even, the program prints "Both 
numbers are even." If only one of the numbers is even, the program prints "One of the numbers is 
even.". Finally, if neither of the numbers is even, the program prints "Both numbers are odd".
First number: 5
Second number: 6
One of the numbers is even
4. Create a program, which asks the user for a number, and calculates the sum of all positive numbers 
from 0 to the user given input.
If the user gives the number 4, the program calculates the sum 0+1+2+3, if 7, the calculation is 
0+1+2+3+4+5+6. 
Program operates as bellow:
Give an integer: 5
The sum was: 10
5. Create a program that can be used as a guessing game. The game is played by Dealer and Player. 
Dealer generates a random integer number between 0 and 10. Player has to guess it. The program 
should take input from Player as long as Player inputs same number as Dealer’s input was. Player gets
advice to choose greater or smaller numbers in next choice. Finally, program has to also display the 
number of tries until the number is guessed.
Program operates as follow:
Player: 2
Try a greater number.
Player: 7
Try a smaller number.
Player: 5
That’s right! Number of tries: 3 
Hint: import random and generate random numbers by using random.randint() in the desired range.
As a bonus (2 points) you can extend your program to allow second play where another player can play 
and finally also display fi Player1 or Player2 wins, by comparing the numbers of tries and choosing the 
one with smaller number.
Player1: 2
Try a greater number.
Player1: 7
Try a smaller number.
Player1: 5
That’s right! Number of tries: 3
 
Player2: 2
Try a greater number.
Player2: 7
Try a smaller number.
Player2: 6
Try a smaller number.
Player2: 5
That’s right! Number of tries:
